## Adafruit QT Py ESP32-S2 ##

This is a super tiny microcontroller from adafruit with the wifi-enabled ESP32-S2 at it's core.

- The [Setup Guide](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/setup.md) will help you get in to the board and start experimenting
- This straightforward [WiFi Guide](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/wifi.md) shows you how simple it can really be to connect the QT Py to a wireless network and start sending http requests using CircuitPython - go from zero to connected to a wireless network and sending a POST request via SSL in 10 lines of code!
- The onboard Neopixel is an awesome way to get information from your board at a glance. This [Neopixel guide](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/neoPixel.md) will add color to your project.
- This board even has capacitive touch detection on several pins, the [Capacitive Touch](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/capacitiveTouch.md) guide is a simple rundown of how to detect touch
