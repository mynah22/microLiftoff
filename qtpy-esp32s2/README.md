## Adafruit QT Py ESP32-S2 ##

This is a super tiny microcontroller from adafruit with the wifi-enabled ESP32-S2 at it's core.


- I really enjoy working in circuitpython on Visual Studio Code - the [VSC set up guide](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/vsc.md) is a couple of easy steps 
- The [Setup Guide](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/setup.md) will help you get in to the board and start experimenting
- This [WiFi Guide](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/wifi.md) demonstrates the simplicity of connecting the QT Py to a wireless network and sending http requests using CircuitPython - go from zero to connected to a wireless network and sending a POST request via SSL in 10 lines of code! 
    - Need somewhere to send data? Spin up a web server with CGI parsing on a Raspberry Pi (or any machine with python 3) using a couple lines of code in this [Python CGI Webserver guide](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/webserver.md)
- The onboard Neopixel is an awesome way to get information from your board at a glance. This [Neopixel guide](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/neoPixel.md) will add color to your project.
- This board even has capacitive touch detection on several pins, the [Capacitive Touch](https://github.com/mynah22/microLiftoff/tree/main/qtpy-esp32s2/capacitiveTouch.md) guide is a simple rundown of how to detect touch
